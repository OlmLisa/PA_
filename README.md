# PA_ Hyperledger Fabric

This project presents the steps to build a private Blockchain as part of the annual project for the bachelor degree.
The goal of this project is to test our skills and to acquire new ones by creating a private Blockchain.

## Objectives :

- Deploy a dealer & retail solution, on a private blockchain, Hyperledger Fabric, for which an interface in React js is expected as well as a middleware in golang language to interact with the
Blockchain and an infrastructure under Docker/Kubernetes

### The technical constraints:
1. Development tools are imposed:
- A Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.
- An interface in React js.
- A middleware to interact with the Blockchain.
- An infrastructure under Docker/Kubernetes.
2. The expected functionalities are:
- Allow a new vehicle to be registered
- Allow to register an arrival of a vehicle
- Allow to register the departure of a vehicle
- Allow to register a breakdown on a vehicle
- Allow to register a repair following a breakdown on a vehicle
- The inventory of the dealership
- Sales figures
- Repair costs
- The turnover of the dealership
Here are some of the use cases :
- The user will be able to browse a list of cars and add a car.
- Once the car is created, the user will be able to modify if the car is with the customer or the dealer
 with a boolean.
- The Blockchain will be able to record the modifications and the insertions of cars.
